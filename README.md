# SimilarLineFromDMM
In this repository, I saved the files for my personal app which does: 
  1) web scraping from "DMM English uknow" site pages on Python and *selenium* package, 
  2) establishment of data pipeline to calculate Japanese sentence similarity based on TF-IDF processed over scraped Japanese sentences at step 1) and encoded by *MeCab*, 
  3) deployment as an app returning similar Japanese sentence by similarity order against user-posted Japanese sentence using *Flask*, and 
  4) making the app accessible through HTML from the world by running it on AWS Linux instance.
