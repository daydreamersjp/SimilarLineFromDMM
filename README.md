# SimilarLineFromDMM
This repository is to save the files of my personal app which 1) do web scraping from "DMM English uknow" site pages, 2) calculate Japanese sentence similarity based on TF-IDF, 3) deploy an app returning similarity values based on Flask, and 4) make the app accessible from the world by running it on AWS.
